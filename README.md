# Overview

Pieces.py contains a number of classes useful for implementing board and card games, demonstrated in the games written in yahtzee.py, poker.py, and blackjack.py. Pieces.py is meant to be a custom library made for this purpose. 

I wrote this software to relearn Python3. I typically create similar projects to these when learning a new language.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
